# Application Requirements

○ You must create an object(s) (based on your design in “Designing your classes”) to store the details of your rental property

Polmorphism in your code 
   ○ You must use a variable of the Rental class to reference the object that will store the details of the rental property.

   ○ ~~The object created will be dependent on the type of rental property selected.~~
      i.e. if the user selected “Room Rental”, then a RoomRental object should be created instead of a WholeRental object.

   ○ You will also use this reference variable when updating and displaying the
   rental property.

   ○ ~~You will need to use a Data Structure (list of lists) of Rental objects to store all the rental properties.~~

~~● At least 1 rental property must be entered before users could select to edit or display the previously entered rental property details.~~

~~● When exiting the application, a confirmation is required to check whether the user really wants to exit~~

● Your code must be commented sufficiently. Areas to note are:
   ○ Comment headers at the top of each class that includes the name of the
   class, the purpose of the class, student name, student id
   ○ All methods should have a docstring that describe what the method is trying
   to do, input required and output produced
   ○ Instance variables: what they are to be used for
   ○ Decision structures: what will happen for each decision path
   ○ Loop structure: what happens during each iteration of the loop when with the loop end

      ○ Other code sections that need additional explanation should include
      comments as well.
      ● Use of good programming practices such as meaningful names, decomposition etc.
